To DO
= General
 - Extend Default View to add event for title as property if none passed default to ''
 - Integrate hammerjs (May require extending default view)

= Build
 - Add requirejs build
 - Conditional HTML stuff (Maybe see notes)

= Nav
 - User profile in nav
 - Nav link styles
 - Animation for profile/links when nav open

= Page Transition
 - Add to viewHandler
 - Add transition in/out
 - Keep copy of view to prevent rerendering


 Notes
 Might not need to add conditional html since running connect on build folder just keep name the same almond would use require style script tags etc
